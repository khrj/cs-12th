# CS QB Answer keys

_This repository is not intended to be used standalone without the given classroom resource_

This repository contains the solutions to each of the question banks given:

1. [Fundamentals and data handling](https://github.com/khrj/cs-qb-answers/tree/main/1-fundamentals-handling)
2. [Data handling libraries](https://github.com/khrj/cs-qb-answers/tree/main/2-data-handling-libraries)
3. [Control flow and iterative statements](https://github.com/khrj/cs-qb-answers/tree/main/3-flow-conditional-iterative)
4. [Strings](https://github.com/khrj/cs-qb-answers/tree/main/4-strings)
5. [Lists](https://github.com/khrj/cs-qb-answers/tree/main/5-lists)
6. [Tuples](https://github.com/khrj/cs-qb-answers/tree/main/6-tuples)
7. [Dictionaries](https://github.com/khrj/cs-qb-answers/tree/main/7-dictionaries)

The answers for the following are designed to be highly compact and use the
smallest number of statements possible.

-   [x] Fundamentals and data handling
-   [ ] Data handling libraries
-   [ ] Control flow and iterative statements
-   [x] Strings
-   [x] Tuples
-   [x] Lists
-   [x] Dictionaries

The shortened answers (unless they're trivial) are _not_ idiomatic. Please do
not write production code using this as an example

I highly recommend using a formatter before trying to understand the code
