7. [Dictionaries](https://github.com/khrj/cs-qb-answers/tree/main/7-dictionaries)

The answers are Strings, Tuples, Lists and Dictionaries are designed to be
highly compact and use the smallest number of statements possible. They may or
may not be idiomatic. I highly recommend using a formatter before trying to
understand the code
